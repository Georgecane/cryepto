# Cryepto
## A open-source cryptography and hashing package for python, this package use all cryptography packages in python to make simpler to use. this package is based on pycryptodome, cryptography, hashlib, random2, binascii, numpy, pyscrypt and many other cryptography packages like nacl.
This package has a large set of function to simplfiy the process of encrypting and decrypting with a large set of algorithms, and of course there are algorithms that no body has been heared the name of it but every month we study, making and reading algorithms in cryptography to be sure all of the algorithms that are secure and fast is included.

# Installation
This package can be installed by pip inside the python, you can use : 
`pip install cryepto` to install and use this package on your python.
